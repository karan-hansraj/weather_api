A simple weather app that allows users to input a city name and retrieve the current weather conditions.

## Features

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Input a city name in the text field.

4. The current weather conditions for the input city will be displayed.

## Code Structure

* `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the input field, button, and display elements.
* `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the button click event, makes an API request to OpenWeatherMap, and updates the display elements with the retrieved weather data.
* `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the HTML elements.

## API Key

Please note that you will need to replace the `API_KEY` variable in `script.js` with your own OpenWeatherMap API key.
